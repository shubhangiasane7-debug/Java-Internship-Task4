Task 4 – Method Design & Modular Calculator

Description:
This project is a simple Modular Calculator application developed using Java.
Each arithmetic operation is implemented in a separate method to demonstrate
method design, modular programming, and code reusability.

Operations Included:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Concepts Used:
- Methods in Java
- Method Overloading
- Return values
- Pass by Value
- Exception Handling (Divide by Zero)
- Modular Programming

Program Features:
- Each operation is implemented in a separate method
- Method overloading is demonstrated using add() method
- Reusable utility method is used to display results
- Exception handling is implemented for division by zero
- Clean and readable modular code structure

How to Run the Program (Windows):
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Compile the program using:
   javac ModularCalculator.java
4. Run the program using:
   java ModularCalculator

Sample Output:
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 15
Addition Result: 27.0
Subtraction Result: -3.0
Multiplication Result: 180.0
Division Result: 0.8
Addition (double): 31.0
